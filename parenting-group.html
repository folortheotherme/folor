                        <h5 class="alt-font font-weight-600 text-extra-dark-gray">Child birth is a joyful experience that is filled with laughter and happiness, and sometimes stress.</h5>
                        <p class="text-large line-height-30 text-medium-gray text-justify xs-text-center xs-line-height-26">With more than twenty percent of women suffering postpartum depression, there is little wonder why women are barely able to get their feet off the ground to work, and are disturbed by anxiety and mood swings.</p>
                        <p class="text-large line-height-30 text-medium-gray text-justify xs-text-center xs-line-height-26">The emotional state of women after their delivery, usually a few months afterwards, can be tricky as their minds need companionship to get them through those dreary days. It is very important that they get themselves out of the house, and connect with other women who have just delivered. A country like Australia understand the importance of social groups for women and newly mums, so there are numerous groups around the country that invite new moms to these social groups to help them in dealing with postpartum stress.</p>
                        <p class="text-large line-height-30 text-medium-gray text-justify xs-text-center xs-line-height-26">While some women feel that their post-delivery phase is the perfect time to stay with their kids and take care of them, it can be a daunting task doing that all by yourself. It doesn't limit your ability as a mother if you leave the comfort of your home to interact with other women. Rather, It helps you as a newly delivered mother to see that there are others who go through the same kind of struggles you go through, and who are willing to help you work through them. </p>
                        <p class="text-large line-height-30 text-medium-gray text-justify xs-text-center xs-line-height-26">Let’s take Jane for example.<br><br>
                        Jane is a twenty five year old first-time mother. She has problems dealing with the incessant baby blues. She sometimes feels abandoned by her husband who is a stock broker. Even though he tries his best to be there for her every time, she feels he is not doing enough and her depression takes the best from her. She feels alone and feels she does not have any other person who understands how hard she's trying, and all the troubles she is going through. Then she is introduced to a mothers' group by a nurse at the hospital and has been happier and healthier since.</p>

                        
                        <p class="text-large line-height-30 text-medium-gray text-justify xs-text-center xs-line-height-26"><a href="https://healthywa.wa.gov.au/Articles/A_E/Common-emotional-problems-in-parents-with-new-babies" style="color: #fd475d; text-decoration: underline;">During the first few weeks after delivery, women experience emotional changes such as baby blues, adjustment problems, anxiety, postpartum psychosis and depression.</a> One of the best ways to deal with these postpartum challenges, according to a research on mental and child Health Journal, is through encouragement of social groups for women.</p>

                        
                        <p class="text-large line-height-30 text-medium-gray text-justify xs-text-center xs-line-height-26">Connecting with other women has been proven to help boost emotional, physical and psychological state. Women, after delivery, need groups and zones where they feel comfortable. They need help, just like Jane, in dealing with the many struggles they go through emotionally. Dennis, a scholar, posited that lack of social support has been identified as a major contributor to poor mental health for new mothers, and this may cause developmental risks for the children. </p>
                        <p class="text-large line-height-30 text-medium-gray text-justify xs-text-center xs-line-height-26">Before a woman selects a social group, it is imperative that she first defines what she wants from the social group and how the group benefits her. It would be foolhardy to rush into any group. Discovering what the group is all about weighing your options and choosing which satisfies your present emotional state. This is important in making necessary adjustments that comes with being a new mother. <br><br>For women who have just delivered, here are some reasons why they need a social group.</p>

                        <h5 class="alt-font font-weight-600 text-extra-dark-gray">1. Helps create peer support group: </h5>
                        <p class="text-large line-height-30 text-medium-gray text-justify xs-text-center xs-line-height-26">It can a nightmare for a mother to go on the journey of motherhood - whether it's her first time or her fifth - alone. The sense of aloneness that comes after delivery can lead to depression and other emotional troubles. This can be tackled significantly when there is social support group. Just like Jane, having other women around share experiences and challenges that looks similar to what you're going through helps you know that you're not alone on the journey. These social groups act like group therapy, they help women connect and heal faster. Sharing can be healing, and social groups provide an avenue to share with other women. </p>
                        <h5 class="alt-font font-weight-600 text-extra-dark-gray">2. Helps women learn from each other: </h5>
                        <p class="text-large line-height-30 text-medium-gray text-justify xs-text-center xs-line-height-26">It is important that women connect with themselves to help them learn faster those things that only motherhood experience can teach. Jane, a first-time mother, would have a number of questions that would bug her, reactions from her child that would leave her clueless, and sometimes depressed. A social group would bring her in direct contact with other women, older and more experienced in child care, who can be anchors and advisers to her on such clueless days. </p>

                        <h5 class="alt-font font-weight-600 text-extra-dark-gray">3. Helps mothers take a break from the isolation of their homes: </h5>
                        <p class="text-large line-height-30 text-medium-gray text-justify xs-text-center xs-line-height-26">Women are advised, in some cultures, to stay at home for at least three months to provide uninterrupted child care to the new born. Being alone could cause and heighten postpartum depression with women. Social groups help take their mind away from the house, helps them connect with other people outside of their immediate family, and this has been proven to help boost mental health. It can also improve other areas of the women's life - work, family and physical state. There is increased motivation that social groups provide women, these motivations are important for growth and development.</p>
                        <h5 class="alt-font font-weight-600 text-extra-dark-gray">4. Helps women gain new insights into various ways of parenting: </h5>
                        <p class="text-large line-height-30 text-medium-gray text-justify xs-text-center xs-line-height-26">There are no hard and fast rules to parenting, still there are a few tricks and parenting methods that new and even old mums can learn from a social group for mothers. A mother who has older children may be finding it difficult dealing with their attitudes and tantrums that come with each milestone they attain, however with a social group, they are able to gain valuable insights into how best to deal with these issues while still considering the uniqueness of their children. </p>
                        <p class="text-large line-height-30 text-medium-gray text-justify xs-text-center xs-line-height-26">Planning play dates, day dates, joining baby groups and keeping up with old friends are some ways (aside joining an organized social group) that you as a new born mum can improve your social life.<br><br>
                        It is perfectly okay to feel a sense of loneliness as a new mom. It is not out of place either to have struggles with taking proper care of your child because parenting, whether for men or women, can be energy sapping and sometimes confusing. Do not feel ashamed to ask for help through a social group. You are not alone in this struggle to be a better mum and a better woman to yourself, your family and your career, so seek help in a social group. Learn to enjoy the company of other women, do not cower in fear at your motherly vulnerabilities, instead take pride in them, you might get a free babysitter from these groups if you ask hard enough.</p>
